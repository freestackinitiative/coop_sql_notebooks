    "### `INNER JOIN` vs `LEFT JOIN` - Caveats & Using them in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the result of the two queries, you should notice that the `LEFT JOIN` query gave you an extra record that was missing from the `INNER JOIN` query. The `sip-n-Bite` company is missing from our first query. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we know that we joined the two tables together based on matching `company_id`. We also know that `INNER JOIN` only keeps records from both tables that match. Since we know that the record exists in the `company` table, that must mean that there is no record for the `sip-n-Bite` company in the `foods` table. You can confirm this by looking at the `foods` table and querying for `company_id=19`, which will return no result since it doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When do I use one over the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether to use an `INNER JOIN` or a `LEFT JOIN` is something you must consider for your particular use case. Do you only want to consider the records that match between your tables? Then choose an `INNER JOIN`. Want to make sure that records are kept from the left side of the join? Then - you guessed it - use a `LEFT JOIN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "By and large, the majority of your joins in practice will either be an `INNER JOIN` or a `LEFT JOIN`. It is worth it to learn them well and become really comfortable with using them, as well as knowing when to use them. The other joins mentioned are not used as much in practice, but it's good to know about them - especially for technical interviews!\n"

    "### Right Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, `RIGHT JOIN` is rarely used in practice. This is because you can do the same thing using just a `LEFT JOIN`, so there aren't many (if any) use cases where you would want to exclusively use it. However, it is a join type to be aware of and is commonly asked about in interviews, so let's cover it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite of the `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN` includes all the records from the \"right-side\" of the join and only records that match from the \"left-side\". Also, similar to `LEFT JOIN`, values in records from the other side of the join that don't match are set to `null` and included in our query results. Visually, the resulting matches look like this:\n",

    "![Right Join](../assets/right-join-company-foods.png)\n",

    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM company -- This is the table on the \"left-side\" of the join\n",
    "RIGHT JOIN foods -- This table is on the \"right-side\" of the join\n",
    "ON foods.company_id=company.company_id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntatically, it is almost identical to the other joins. Let's run a `RIGHT JOIN` query and see the results.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Now it's your turn!**\n",
    "\n",

    "From the results of the `RIGHT JOIN`, we can see that it indeed kept all of the records from the `foods` table (since it's on the right-side of the join) and gave null values in the records from the `company` table that didn't match.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Outer Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "`FULL OUTER JOIN` is another join type that isn't used as often as left or inner joins in practice, but it is much more common than the `RIGHT JOIN`. We use `FULL OUTER JOIN` when we want to include all the records from both sides of the join, showing the records that match between the two and otherwise giving null values where there isn't a match between the tables. A `FULL OUTER JOIN` is like a combination of both the left and right join types.\n",

    "#### Summary of Joins\n",
    "To sum things up, we use joins to combine data from different sources to add context to our analysis. When we join two tables, the records are matched based on a constraint that we specify, with the most common being that the value on one side of the join is equal to the value on the other. Joins also have types, which affect what rows are returned from a query. The four primary types are `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `FULL OUTER` joins. Of these four, the two most common are `INNER` and `LEFT`. "

    "# Theory Section - Joins and multiple tables\n",
    "\n",
    "If you feel confident in your understanding of joins, or you want to try some practical exercises first before diving into theory, skip ahead to the practice section below this. Otherwise, read on to learn about what joins are, why we use them, and how to include them in your queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are joins and why do we use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we join data, we are merging two or more related tables into a single view, typically to add context to some analysis. This is accomplished by using common attributes (aka *columns*) to establish relationships between the tables along with constraints that control how records (aka *rows*) are matched between them. There are four primary join types that each have their own affect on query results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A hypothetical join scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you have two tables, one with `company` data and another with `product` data. It would be useful to see a combined view of companies and their products for an analysis or report. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we would join the `customer` and `product` tables together using a common field (or fields) that establish a relationship between them. In a relational database, this is generally done using a primary key/foreign key relationship. Then we would establish a constraint to determine how the rows should be matched between the two tables in the resulting query. The most common constraint is to specify that only matching values between the tables be included in the join (Ex: `A.column_a = B.column_a`). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Working through an example of the most common join - the `INNER JOIN`\n",
    "\n",
    "Joins can be a difficult topic, so let's practice doing some together and then we'll explain what is happening as we go.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first type of join we'll look at is the `INNER JOIN`. When we use an `INNER JOIN`, we are saying that we only want the values that match between the two tables based on our constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we have two tables, `A` and `B`, that we want to join together and only include the records that are common to both tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what the query would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query**\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    A.column1,\n",
    "    B.column1\n",
    "FROM A -- This is the table on the \"left-side\" of the join\n",
    "-- Specifying the join type\n",
    "INNER JOIN B -- This is the table on the \"right-side\" of the join\n",
    "-- Specifying the join column (`column1`) and constraint (`=`)\n",
    "ON A.column1=B.column1 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a visual representation of which results will be returned between the two tables after the join:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What gets matched between the two tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Inner Join](https://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/Visual_SQL_Joins/INNER_JOIN.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, we're keeping only the results between the two tables that match based on our join columns and constraints. These results will only include those rows that matched and will drop data from both sides of the join that don't match. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the syntax of the join, we always specify the join type, column(s), and constraint(s) together. Joins come after the `FROM` clause and before the `WHERE` and `GROUP BY` clauses in our queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "To specify the type of join, we use the following form: \n",
    "\n",
    "`{Join Type} {name of table to join}`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** `INNER JOIN company`\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify the column and constraint, we use the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "`{First Table.Column to join on} {constraint} {Second Table.Column to join on}`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** `foods.company_id=company.company_id`\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together, writing the join would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "INNER JOIN company\n",
    "ON foods.company_id=order_details.company_id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Note: We typically use dot (`.`) notation when we join two or more tables in >SQL. This is so that we don’t confuse the SQL engine when two tables have >columns with the same name. Here’s the syntax: `table_name.column_name`*\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, there are **four join types** that you should be aware of (and which we will cover):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `INNER JOIN`: Only keep the records that match the constraint between the two tables\n",
    "- `LEFT JOIN`: Keep all the records from the left-side of the join, and only show values for the records on the right-side that matched. Any values from the right-side that weren't matched will be assigned a `null` value.\n",
    "- `RIGHT JOIN`: The opposite of the `LEFT JOIN` - keep all the records from the right-side of the join and only show values for the records on the left-side that matched. Any values from the left-sie that weren't matched will be assigned a `null` value.\n",
    "- `FULL OUTER JOIN`: Keep all records between both tables, but only show the values that match my constraint. All other records that don't match will be included, but those values will be set to null.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will dive a bit deeper into the details of each of these join types as we work through some practical examples in the next section of this notebook. Also, these are only four join types out of many. There are some more advanced joins, like [cross-joins, natural joins, and self-joins](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-difference-between-natural-joincross-join-self-madhu-mitha-k) that you should eventually become familiar with as you enhance your skills and understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical considerations for selecting attributes/columns for joins\n",
    "\n",
    "Joining datasets usually depends on primary and foreign key relationships, but these aren't always clear (or available), especially with unfamiliar data. In such cases, understanding the data's origin, purpose, and contents can help. This can be done by finding documentation like data dictionaries or entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) or consulting with subject matter experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there's no documentation or experts, exploratory data analysis becomes crucial. This involves understanding column data types, summary statistics, and identifying missing values. Aim to identify unique identifier columns, or potential primary keys for joins, which should be unique and non-null. [The information_schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_schema), found in many relational databases, can also provide helpful metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step in joining datasets is connecting tables using primary keys identified earlier. If key relationships are known, this is simple. Otherwise, analyze and understand primary keys, look for common columns, and try joining. Duplicates after joining suggest incorrect column usage. This illustrates why it is crucial for you to understand your data.\n",

    "As an example, we'll join the `company` and `foods` table together. There is already a primary key/foreign key relationship between the two tables established by the `company_id` column. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both tables have the `company_id` column. The primary key in this relationship is the `company_id` column from the `company` table, since it ensures that each row of `company` is unique. And, as you probably guessed, the foreign key is the `company_id` column from the `foods` table, which establishes the relationship with the `customer` table.\n",

    "### Left Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "A `LEFT JOIN` is the other most common join after `INNER JOIN`. The difference between the two is how the records are matched in the query result. While an `INNER JOIN` includes only the records that match on both sides of the join, a `LEFT JOIN` will keep all the records from the left-side of the join and only those that match from the right-side. When this happens, instead of dropping those records like the `INNER JOIN`, any values in unmatched records are set to `null`. Visually, the matched records will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Left Join](assets/left-join-company-foods.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're new to `LEFT JOIN`, you're probably wondering what was meant before by \"left-side of the join.\" Visually, we can see that there is a table on the left side that has all of the records included with only the records at the intersection included from the right. But how does that translate to an actual query?\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM company -- This is the table on the \"left-side\" of the join\n",
    "LEFT JOIN foods -- This table is on the \"right-side\" of the join\n",
    "ON company.company_id=foods.company_id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, the table on the \"left\" of a join type is the one used in the `FROM` clause and the table on the \"right\" is the one specified after the join type (`LEFT JOIN` in this case.) Columns and constraints otherwise work the same as the `INNER JOIN`. The syntax is virtually identical between the two joins, but it's important to know how they work and the caveats for all join types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the `LEFT JOIN` query that we wrote above in the cell below and compare the results with the query we ran earlier using an `INNER JOIN`. Can you see the difference?\n",

    "### `INNER JOIN` vs `LEFT JOIN` - Caveats & Using them in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the result of the two queries, you should notice that the `LEFT JOIN` query gave you an extra record that was missing from the `INNER JOIN` query. The `sip-n-Bite` company is missing from our first query. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we know that we joined the two tables together based on matching `company_id`. We also know that `INNER JOIN` only keeps records from both tables that match. Since we know that the record exists in the `company` table, that must mean that there is no record for the `sip-n-Bite` company in the `foods` table. You can confirm this by looking at the `foods` table and querying for `company_id=19`, which will return no result since it doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When do I use one over the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether to use an `INNER JOIN` or a `LEFT JOIN` is something you must consider for your particular use case. Do you only want to consider the records that match between your tables? Then choose an `INNER JOIN`. Want to make sure that records are kept from the left side of the join? Then - you guessed it - use a `LEFT JOIN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "By and large, the majority of your joins in practice will either be an `INNER JOIN` or a `LEFT JOIN`. It is worth it to learn them well and become really comfortable with using them, as well as knowing when to use them. The other joins mentioned are not used as much in practice, but it's good to know about them - especially for technical interviews!\n"

    "### Right Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, `RIGHT JOIN` is rarely used in practice. This is because you can do the same thing using just a `LEFT JOIN`, so there aren't many (if any) use cases where you would want to exclusively use it. However, it is a join type to be aware of and is commonly asked about in interviews, so let's cover it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite of the `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN` includes all the records from the \"right-side\" of the join and only records that match from the \"left-side\". Also, similar to `LEFT JOIN`, values in records from the other side of the join that don't match are set to `null` and included in our query results. Visually, the resulting matches look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Right Join](assets/right-join-company-foods.png)\n",

    "RIGHT JOIN foods -- This table is on the \"right-side\" of the join\n",
    "ON foods.company_id=company.company_id\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "### Full Outer Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "`FULL OUTER JOIN` is another join type that isn't used as often as left or inner joins in practice, but it is much more common than the `RIGHT JOIN`. We use `FULL OUTER JOIN` when we want to include all the records from both sides of the join, showing the records that match between the two and otherwise giving null values where there isn't a match between the tables. A `FULL OUTER JOIN` is like a combination of both the left and right join types.\n",

    "To sum things up, we use joins to combine data from different sources to add context to our analysis. When we join two tables, the records are matched based on a constraint that we specify, with the most common being that the value on one side of the join is equal to the value on the other. Joins also have types, which affect what rows are returned from a query. The four primary types are `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `FULL OUTER` joins. Of these four, the two most common are `INNER` and `LEFT`. "

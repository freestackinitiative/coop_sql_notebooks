# COOP SQL (unofficial) Notebooks

These notebooks are meant to accompany the slide deck lectures for the SQL 101 and 102 practical sections. They are meant to give students an environment in which they can easily practice and experiment with SQL by querying and manipulating data from a database. The data sets in these notebooks correspond to the ones that are covered in the lecture.

Each notebook has a practice section set up for each major topic covered in its respective lesson. There are also some extra practice sessions included: A pattern-matching section in the 101 workbook, and a deeper dive into joins in the 102 workbook. At the end of each notebook are a list of resources for extra practice.

I also recommend this [SQL Cheat Sheet](https://martinmarroyo.github.io/sqlcheatsheetandresources-coop/) to use as a companion to the notebooks and lessons. I made the cheat sheet with the lesson content in SQL 101 and 102 in mind.

You can open the notebooks directly in Google Colab by using the links below next to the notebook title:

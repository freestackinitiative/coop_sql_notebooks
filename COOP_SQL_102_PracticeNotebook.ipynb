It is similar to the `DISTINCT` operation and should be used sparingly. If performance becomes an issue (e.g. query takes too long to run), switch to using `UNION ALL` - you’ll get duplicate rows but your query will run faster.

This is useful for hierarchical or tree-structured data, like organizational charts. Subqueries cannot do this. This is out of the scope of this course, but is worth mentioning regardless.\n",
        "\n",

For the results of both the top and bottom queries to align, the columns you select must have the same data type and be in the same order in both queries. You’ll see that we use columns with the same data type and in the same order for the “bottom query.”\n",

    "Another important distinction to make here is that by saying `UNION`, we are also telling SQL that we don’t want duplicate values in our final query result. If we instead didn’t need to remove duplicates, we could use `UNION ALL` instead, which leaves in the duplicate rows between the top and bottom query.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Pro-Tip**: While using just `UNION` is handy when we don’t want duplicate rows in our results, it can cause performance issues when we are working with larger data sets. It is similar to the `DISTINCT` operation and should be used sparingly. If performance becomes an issue (e.g. query takes too long to run), switch to using `UNION ALL` - you’ll get duplicate rows but your query will run faster. Whether or not to make the tradeoff on performance vs. convenience is a judgement call you will have to make depending on your situation."

    "\n",
    "- `INNER JOIN`: Only keep the records that match the constraint between the two tables\n",
    "\n",
    "- `LEFT JOIN`: Keep all the records from the left-side of the join, and only show values for the records on the right-side that matched. Any values from the right-side that weren't matched will be assigned a `null` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `RIGHT JOIN`: The opposite of the `LEFT JOIN` - keep all the records from the right-side of the join and only show values for the records on the left-side that matched. Any values from the left-sie that weren't matched will be assigned a `null` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `FULL OUTER JOIN`: Keep all records between both tables, but only show the values that match my constraint. All other records that don't match will be included, but those values will be set to null.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **two types of `UNION` queries** you should know:\n",
    "- `UNION ALL`: All results from tables in the `UNION` are included, even if there are duplicate rows\n",
    "- `UNION`: Removes all duplicate rows from the `UNION` of the tables\n",

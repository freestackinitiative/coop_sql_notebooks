    "A crime has taken place and detectives need your help! You were given the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a `​murder`​ that occurred sometime on `​January 15, 2018`​ and that it took place in ​`SQL City`​. It is up to you to find out who the murderer is using just your SQL skills and resourcefulness. You are given a connection to the Police Department's database which has all of the clues you'll need to track down the killer. \n",

The police department's database has an information schema, with the `tables` view showing you what tables are available, and the `columns` view which shows you all the columns for each table and their data types.

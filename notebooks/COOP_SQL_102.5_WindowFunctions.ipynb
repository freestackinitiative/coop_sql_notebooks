    "You're making great strides in your SQL journey! Now that you’ve mastered the basics like `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `GROUP BY`, and even delved into subqueries, it’s time to explore window functions. These powerful tools will allow you to perform advanced calculations across your data.\n",

    "All of your queries will be written using preloaded databases that are available only in this notebook. Our \"RDBMS\" and SQL dialect is called `duckdb`, a new and popular Python library that provides the framework to make our queries possible. You can find [the documentation for `duckdb` here](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/introduction) - you will want to keep the documentation handy.\n",

    "`teachdb`, which provides the data that you will be working with, is a Python library written by The Freestack Initiative, a group of COOP alumni who want to empower the community to learn and improve their technical skills by providing materials and resources at low (or no) cost."

    "Imagine you're a chef in a busy restaurant. You have a list of all orders for the night, and you want to calculate the total bill for each table while still seeing the breakdown of each individual dish. Window functions let you do this by performing calculations across sets of table rows that are related to the current row.\n",

    "The first window function we'll use is `ROW_NUMBER`. This is a handy function to know, since it allows us to assign unique numbers to our rows based on some kind of order we assign. This is useful in scenarios where you need to assign a unique ID to rows in your query or want to be able to select from the top *N* number of results.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a straightforward `SELECT` query except for the 3rd line where we start the `ROW_NUMBER`. The `ROW_NUMBER()` function assigns a unique number to each row within the result set. The `OVER` clause, which is **always needed in a window function**, specifies how the rows should be ordered. In this case, we order the rows by `Price` in descending order and by `Name` in ascending order. This will give the highest priced dishes a lower number and the lowest priced dishes a higher one, and all of them will be unique (from 1 to *N*)."
